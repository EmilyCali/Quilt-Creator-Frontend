# Quilt-Creator-Frontend

This is the repository for the frontend angularjs and express app created for the Web Development Immersive Remote Program Spring 2017 as part of the final project.

You can also visit the live backend but it won't show you much <a href="https://quilt-creator-api.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

<h2> The Idea </h2>

Miss Cali created this app based off of an idea she had had during the second week of class after a morning exercise involving creating a digital quilt. Miss Cali makes quilts in her free time and was not able to do much sewing while the class was going on. She was eager to attempt to create something that could help her with one of her passions.

Originally she wanted to have this app be a place to diagram quilts as well as do the math for the user on how much fabric would be needed.

<h2> The Process </h2>

As this project developed Miss Cali changed her plans to just be the math for the quilts. She hadn't seen many sites or apps that did the math for you in an understandable way when it came to determining yardage requirements. In her experience with quilting this was one of the hardest parts of quilting, getting the right amount of fabric.

<h2> The Struggles </h2>

Miss Cali struggled with some of the organization of this project, she began with a many to many relationship and researching how to create drag and drop images and save them to a backend. She couldn't wrap her head around it and went to a one to many relationship that made sense to her.

She also had some struggles with modals and responsive design. 

<h2> The Wins </h2>

This app is complete, there is crud on the user and create and read for the second model. Miss Cali is very proud of the responsive nature of this site and happy that all the math and data calls work.

<h2> What's Next </h2>

After the class is complete Emily hopes to continue developing this app to include image uploads, the ability to state color varieties and determine yardages for each and the chance to make this a more useful sharing tool for quilters.
